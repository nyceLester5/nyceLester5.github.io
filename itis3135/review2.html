    <h3>Evaluation</h3>

    <p>
        The homepage is very polished and professional-looking, with excellent spacing, consistent branding, and a clean layout. The navigation is clear and accessible, with buttons that visually match the rest of the site. The hero section and consultation call-to-action are strong and visually appealing. The picture placement is consistent on multiple pages, supporting a cohesive design. The color palette is refined and easy on the eyes, with good contrast and readability.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "About" page cleanly introduces the client with an appropriate hierarchy, and the content is well written. The typography is consistent, with strong alignment and visual rhythm. The mission and client information are easy to read and clearly structured. The layout is centered and well-balanced.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "Office" page contains a fully developed form that is visually aligned and easy to navigate. Fields are spaced properly, and the dropdown is styled effectively. The virtual office information is clear and direct, and the Zoom link is well placed. The footer continues the site's clean style with contact information and validation badges.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Services page includes multiple well-formatted service descriptions that follow a uniform card style. The FAQ section is clean, with expandable rows that add interactivity. This is an excellent use of dynamic content. The spacing and card alignment remain consistent across the page.
    </p>

    <h3>Checklist Review</h3>

    <p>
        The site begins with a clear header that includes the brand name and navigation. The page leads directly to the intended project content without confusion. File and folder naming appear consistent and lowercase. The design uses sufficient contrast and readable font sizing. CRAP principles are applied effectively, especially alignment and proximity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each page contains a correct structure with header, main, and footer components. The header includes the site name in an h1, not the page name, which is correct for a branded site. Each page begins the main content with an h2 naming the page. The brand tagline or professional title appears consistently below the name. The footer includes links, contact details, and validation badges.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Observations</h3>

    <p>
        The interactive FAQ accordion is a strong feature and enhances usability. The carousel-like slider at the top of the homepage adds dynamic engagement. Overall, the site feels highly polished and nearly market-ready. One suggestion is to increase contrast slightly in the pale blue gradient sections for improved accessibility. Another potential enhancement would be animating the navigation bar or including subtle hover transitions for even smoother interaction.
