        <h3>Checklist Evaluation</h3>

        <p>
          The page loads correctly, and the submission links directly to the correct file. 
          File and folder names follow required naming conventions and avoid uppercase 
          characters. The color contrast, font sizing, and overall readability meet course 
          expectations. The page follows consistent use of CRAP principles through strong 
          alignment, thoughtful proximity, and repetition in layout styling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The header includes the site title in an appropriate manner and does not incorrectly 
          include the page name. The page correctly uses a structured format containing a 
          header, main section, and footer. The main content begins with a clear page heading 
          that describes the purpose of the page without including the overall site name. The 
          page includes a clear brand identity that is consistent across the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          The footer includes navigation links and validation badges, consistent with the 
          assignment expectations. All links appear functional and direct users to the proper 
          locations. No issues were found with broken images or layout inconsistency. The page 
          appears to meet all structural requirements for this assignment phase.
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment Requirements Review</h3>

        <p>
          The project overview includes clear descriptions of the application purpose and 
          intended users. The content overview section outlines all planned pages and captures 
          what each page will include. Wireframes and the sitemap are included and formatted 
          neatly, giving a strong visual understanding of the planned structure. Page designs 
          for Home, About, Portfolio, Services, and Contact are fully written out with their 
          purpose, target users, and expected features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dynamic functionality is documented, including a lightbox gallery and persistent 
          navigation bar. These are appropriate features for the project and align well with 
          the photographer-focused site. Overall, the project overview is fully developed and 
          reflects strong planning for the final implementation.
        </p>

        <h3>Additional Feedback</h3>

        <p>
          The visual layout is clean and easy to follow. The background color and typography 
          create a calm, readable design, although slightly stronger color contrast could 
          improve accessibility. Screenshots and diagrams are large and easy to read. The 
          hierarchy of headings is well-structured, making the page easy to navigate.
        </p>

        <p>
          For future improvements, consider adding short descriptive labels above each image 
          (such as “Homepage Wireframe”) to clarify the section at a glance. You may also want 
          to include brief explanations about image sources or tools used. Other than that, 
          the content is thorough, the structure is strong, and the project appears to be 
          progressing well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, this is a well-prepared project overview that demonstrates thoughtful 
          planning and clear organization. Great work so far.
