    <ul class="bio-list">
      <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hi, I’m Tranyce. My hometown is Raeford, North Carolina. I moved to Charlotte about three years ago to attend UNCC, and I am now a junior.</li>

      <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’m a motivated designer and developer with experience in customer engagement and technology through roles at Apple and Walgreens. My background has strengthened my ability to connect people and products through clear communication, problem-solving, and empathy. Now, I’m focused on building intuitive, accessible digital experiences that blend creativity with technical precision, bringing ideas to life through thoughtful UX and clean, functional code.</li>

      <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2021 and attended UNCC. I originally majored in Mechanical Engineering. After my first year, I took a year off and came back to school, changing my major to Computer Science (B.A.) with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.</li>

      <li><strong>Background in This Subject:</strong> I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS and a growing interest in user experience design, particularly in identifying usability problems and creating thoughtful design solutions. I also have programming experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, C, and SQL, which helps me bridge the gap between design and development.</li>

      <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> MacOS and Windows.</li>

      <li>
        <strong>Courses I’m Taking &amp; Why:</strong><br>
        <strong>ITCS 3140 – User Experience Methods:</strong> I am interested in designing apps.<br>
        <strong>ITIS 3135 – Web-Based Programming:</strong> I am also interested in web design and what goes into how a website works. I felt this class would help me better my understanding and skills.<br>
        <strong>ITIS 4166 – Backend Web Development:</strong> A required course for my concentration.<br>
        <strong>ITIS 5353 – Social Technology Design:</strong> I haven’t got a good grasp on what exactly this class is yet, but it was required.<br>
        <strong>ITSC 5358 – Physical Computing:</strong> Focuses on 3D modeling and printing.<br>
        <strong>MATH 2223 – Elements of Statistics II:</strong> I’m not a big fan of math, but it was required.
