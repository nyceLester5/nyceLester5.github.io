    <h2>Project Overview: Pastry Portfolio for Chef Jazmin Lester</h2>

    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
  <h3>Application Description</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a professional pastry portfolio website designed for Pastry Chef Jazmin Lester. 
    The site showcases her custom cakes, desserts, and bakery collaborations while also presenting her 
    flavor offerings, menu options, and weekly schedule. The primary purpose of the application is to 
    increase her online visibility and provide potential customers with a polished and organized way to 
    explore her work and submit non-transactional order inquiries. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The intended users include local customers searching for custom desserts, event planners organizing 
    special occasions, bakery owners seeking collaboration opportunities, and returning customers or fans 
    browsing new work. The website content includes a biography, a dessert gallery, a menu of flavors and 
    pricing guidance, a structured inquiry form, her weekly schedule, location information, and an optional 
    testimonials or FAQ section.

    <!-- PAGE DESIGN DETAILS -->
    <section>
  <h3>Page Design Details</h3>

  <p>
    Each page in the pastry portfolio website follows a consistent structure that includes the shared header, 
    navigation bar, footer, and responsive content areas. The Home page introduces the brand and welcomes the 
    user with a hero banner, a brief introduction to Chef Jazmin, and images of featured desserts that open in 
    a modal viewer. The main purpose of this page is to attract and orient visitors, and it does not include 
    any data-entry fields or validation. Animation or soft transitions may be used to enhance the user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The About page presents Chef Jazmin’s background, experience, and baking philosophy. It is designed for 
    users who want to learn more about the chef before placing an inquiry. The page includes narrative content, 
    portrait images, and a mission statement. It does not include form fields or validation. Internal navigation 
    links guide users toward exploring the menu or submitting an order inquiry, and optional visual effects can 
    accompany major content sections.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Menu and Gallery page serves customers who wish to browse dessert categories or view images of previous 
    creations. It includes interactive dessert categories organized with jQuery UI tabs and high-quality images 
    that open in a lightbox-style viewer. No data-entry fields appear on this page, and no validation is required. 
    Visitors can switch among categories, explore the gallery, and access ordering options from within the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Order Inquiry page supports customers who want to request custom dessert orders. It includes a structured 
    form with fields for the customer’s name, email, dessert type, flavor selection, event date, serving size, 
    and additional notes. JavaScript provides client-side validation for required fields, email formatting, and 
    valid date selection, and the date picker is implemented using jQuery UI. A confirmation message appears upon 
    successful submission, though no data is stored to comply with the course’s no-CRUD requirement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Schedule and Location page offers users a clear view of Chef Jazmin’s weekly operating hours along with 
    a map showing her bakery pickup or consultation location. The schedule is loaded dynamically from a JSON file 
    using AJAX, which allows content updates without modifying the HTML markup. The page does not use input fields 
    or validation and includes an embedded Google Map for geographic context.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Testimonials and FAQ page strengthens trust and addresses the common questions customers may have about 
    orders, timelines, pricing, and quality. This page contains customer feedback and an accordion-style FAQ powered 
    by jQuery UI, allowing users to expand and collapse each question. No forms or validation appear on this page, 
    and its interactive components focus solely on improving user comprehension.
  </p>

    <!-- DYNAMIC FUNCTIONALITY -->
    <section>
  <h3>Planned Dynamic Functionality</h3>
  <p>
    The website incorporates multiple layers of interactivity using JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI, and AJAX. 
    One of the core dynamic components is the interactive photo gallery, where dessert images open in a 
    lightbox-style modal viewer to allow visitors to explore each item in detail. A similar concept can be seen 
    in the lightbox example provided by W3Schools at 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp" target="_blank">this link</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Menu and Gallery page includes jQuery UI tabs to organize dessert categories into clear groupings. This 
    helps users explore multiple sections without scrolling through an overwhelming amount of content. The jQuery 
    UI demonstration at <a href="https://jqueryui.com/tabs/" target="_blank">this link</a> shows the inspiration 
    for this feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FAQ section on the Testimonials page uses a jQuery UI accordion to provide an expandable question-and-answer 
    interface. This format improves readability and reduces visual clutter by allowing users to expand only the 
    questions that interest them. A reference implementation can be seen at 
    <a href="https://jqueryui.com/accordion/" target="_blank">this demo</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Order Inquiry page uses JavaScript to validate fields such as name, email format, and date selection. 
    The purpose of this functionality is to improve data quality before the user submits the form. This approach 
    mirrors the validation techniques illustrated at 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp" target="_blank">this reference example</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Schedule and Location page incorporates an AJAX request to load weekly hours stored in a JSON file. This 
    method allows the weekly schedule to remain easily editable without making structural changes to the HTML. A 
    similar AJAX pattern is demonstrated at 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_getjson.asp" target="_blank">this link</a>.
  </p>

    <!-- NOTES -->
    <section>
  <h3>Notes & References</h3>
  <p>
    This project references common design patterns found in small business portfolio websites, including 
    dessert bakeries and independent chef portfolios. The site structure, form validation methods, and 
    dynamic interface elements were informed by examples from W3Schools, jQuery UI documentation, and 
    industry-standard web design resources. This project overview was prepared by Tranyce Lester.
